# Smart Home Control System Tablet Interface
This project aims to develop a smart home control system application using Redux Toolkit and React. The application integrates with the following devices and features:

##  Features
The combination of these functionalities provides users with comprehensive control over their smart home devices, allowing them to create customized automation scenarios that align with their needs and preferences.

#### 游릭Adding New Scenarios:
Users can add new scenarios to customize their smart home automation. This allows them to define specific combinations of devices and their desired behaviors.

#### 游릭Reordering Active Scenarios:
Users have the ability to change the order of their active scenarios. This allows for flexible prioritization and sequencing of different automation scenarios.

#### 游릭Adjusting Delay Time for Active Scenarios: 
Users can set the delay time for each active scenario. This feature enables them to introduce delays between actions, providing more control over the execution of their smart home automation.

#### 游릭Deleting Scenarios:
Users can remove unwanted scenarios from their list. This feature allows for easy management and customization of the automation scenarios.

#### 游릭Selecting from 7 Different Scenario Types: 
The application supports seven different types of scenarios: garage, thermometer, lamp, alarm, curtain, valve, and boiler. Users can choose from these scenario types to create their desired automation combinations.

#### 游릭Futuristic GUI:
The application boasts a futuristic visual interface, providing an immersive and modern user experience. The interface is designed to be visually appealing and intuitive for easy control and monitoring of the smart home devices.

#### 游릭Type-filtered Sorting: 
The application offers sorting options based on scenario types. Users can organize their scenarios based on the device or function they control, making it easier to find and manage specific scenarios.
